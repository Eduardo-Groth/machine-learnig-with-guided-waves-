# machine-learnig-with-guided-waves
codes done in python & matlab to run and work with the package ABAQUS
main goal: created rotines to test machine learning techniques to pos process signals of mechanical guided waves 
enginnner interest: detection of damages in structures - monitoring of damages - ultrassonics guided waves inspection 

first realese of the script calls: V0
